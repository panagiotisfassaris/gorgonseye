Gorgon's Eye is a symmetric key encryptor and decryptor project by Panagiotis Fassaris, implemented in C++ without the use of any third-party libraries.

---------------
Usage:
---------------

encrypt.exe:

./encrypt --help | Provides help on how to use the encrypt.cpp.
./encrypt -f <input file> | Encrypts a single .txt file.
./encrypt -r | Recursively encrypts all files in the current directory.
After running encrypt.cpp, a key.bin file will be generated. Be careful not to lose this key; otherwise, you won't be able to decrypt your files.

decrypt.exe:

./decrypt --help | Provides help on how to use the decrypt.cpp.
./decrypt -f <input file> <path/to/key.bin> | Decrypts a single .txt file.
./decrypt -r <path/to/key.bin> | Recursively decrypts all files in the current directory.

---------------
Future Updates:
---------------

-Availability as a Python (.py) script.
-Asymmetric encryption option (AES-256).
